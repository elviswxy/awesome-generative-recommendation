# Awesome Generative Recommendation

A curated, practical, and research-oriented repository for the next generation of recommendation systems. 

This repository brings together datasets, papers, tutorials, benchmarks, and practical guides for building generative recommendation systems. Our goal is to provide a unified resource center for researchers and engineers exploring how modern generative technologies can reshape retrieval, ranking, and personalized recommendation.
